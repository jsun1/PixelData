PixelData
=========

an iOS tool for getting pixel measurements and RGB values from screenshots

TODO:

1. bring up share sheet to share the image
2. make a "Ruler" UIView class that draws itself and is updated every time the scrollView scrolls/zooms
3. make a "ColorPicker" class that gives the RGB of the image at a point. Also make a UIView indicator of that point & color (like a popover on the image)
