PixelData
=========

an iOS tool for getting pixel measurements and RGB values from screenshots

TODO:

1. Share sheet (Abhinav)
 - share the screenshot
2. Ruler/scrollview (Jeff)
 - be able to select pixels near the corners - scrollview's content offset?
3. Color picker (Bruno)
 - color picker should float above rulers - make it subview of root view instead of scrollview
 - info from picker should persist on screen somehow
